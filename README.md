### ft_printf (Grade: 120/125)
The key a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.

**Mandatory part**
- Implement the following conversions:
   - %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %% 

**Bonus part**
- Manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.’ and the field minimum width under all conversions.
- Manage all the following flags: ’# +’ (Yes, one of them is a space)
